# Jungle Adventure - Godot project  (project #1 in github)
Here I will post all scripts used in my project 'Jungle Adventure' in Godot! It is made with a tutorial in a book.

Jungle Adventure is a plataforming game where you control a fox and get trough various hazards and plataforms, while collecting gems and cherries that increase your score. Very generic, I know. It's made in a tutorial, after all!
